#### GLOBAL GEO COMPOSITE CREATOR ####

These scripts produce global geostationary composite imagery from
Himawari-8, GOES-16, GOES-18, Meteosat-9 and Meteosat-10.

## Setup

The global geo composite creator requires a python virtual environment, 
which holds all necessary libraries. It also requires the xRITDecompress 
binary from EUMETSAT to read in the SEVIRI dataset.

Run:
```
bash config.sh
```

Then navigate into the EUMETSAT repo, e.g.:
cd /home/users/$USER/bin/PublicDecompWT/xRITDecompress

Edit the Makefile:
line 6: DEST_DIR=/home/users/$(USER)
line 20-21: comment out

Run to compile the xRITDecompress binary (we will need this path in the ./run_geo script):
make


To run, simply execute:
 python Global_GEO.py

And the script will process the most recent suitable timeslot
(hourly, due to SEVIRI license restrictions imposed on the RSG
group). To process older data, instead run the script with a
command line argument specifying the desired timeslot:
 python Global_GEO.py 202210051200
Where the timeslot is in YYYYmmddHHMM format.

This script requires numerous libraries, most notably:
 - satpy and dependencies
 - s3fs
 - gdal

Also note that for performance reasons, an internal satpy function
( _get_sensor_angles) is used. This is not a supported function so
the utility may break at any point in the future.
