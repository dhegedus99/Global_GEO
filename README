#### GLOBAL GEO COMPOSITE CREATOR ####

These scripts produce global geostationary composite imagery from
Himawari-8, GOES-16, GOES-18, Meteosat-9 and Meteosat-10.

To run, simply execute:
 python Global_GEO.py

And the script will process the most recent suitable timeslot
(hourly, due to SEVIRI license restrictions imposed on the RSG
group). To process older data, instead run the script with a
command line argument specifying the desired timeslot:
 python Global_GEO.py 202210051200
Where the timeslot is in YYYYmmddHHMM format.

This script requires numerous libraries, most notably:
 - satpy and dependencies
 - s3fs
 - gdal

Also note that for performance reasons, an internal satpy function
( _get_sensor_angles) is used. This is not a supported function so
the utility may break at any point in the future.
